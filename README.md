# To get started
1. Download **Selenium python pkg** by ```pip install selenium``` or [Google it](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/).
2. Install the driver in ```/Driver``` to your system.
3. Now, open the desired script in any code editor and run it.

# Important
Carefully follow the guidelines given in ```ReadMe.txt``` of every script for proper functioning.
