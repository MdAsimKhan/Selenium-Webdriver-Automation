# Selenium Webdriver Automation

Container of my selenium automation scripts

# To get started

1. Download **Selenium python pkg** by `pip install selenium` or [Google it](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal.
3. Open the desired script in any code editor and run it.

# Important

Carefully follow the guidelines given in `ReadMe.txt` of every script for proper functioning.

# Note

If the script fails sometime, try again! (Also, you can see what was the error in your terminal from where you ran the script)
